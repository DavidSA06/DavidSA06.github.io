# David Silva's Portfolio

Hi I am **David Silva**, Master in Sciences (Applied Physics). Currently I am working as a digital producer, scientific advisor and technical proofreader. In addition I'm interested Data Analysis due to my background in mathematics, handling electronic sensor data, and my experience as a leader of a scientific outreach group. On this page you will find evidence of my work.
