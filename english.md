# English

I obtained skills to communicate in English during my school studies from elementary to high school. I also studied English at DGIE-BUAP reaching the Advanced 1 level. I have recently reviewed my studies in [Platzi](platzi.md), an online learning platform, in which I reached the Upper Intermediate level.
