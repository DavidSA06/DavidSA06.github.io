# Japanese (日本語)

I have done my Japanese studies at the Puebla Japanese Language Center (プ エ ブ ラ 日本語 学校), finishing my studies at the pre-intermediate level. I have also obtained the N5 level certificate issued by the [Japan Foundation](https://www.jpf.go.jp/e/), which is the only Japanese institution dedicated to the Japanese culture dissemination.
