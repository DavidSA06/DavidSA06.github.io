# Japanese (日本語)

I have done my Japanese studies at the Puebla Japanese Language School (プエブラ日本語学校), finishing my studies at the pre-intermediate level. I have also obtained the N5 level certificate issued by the [Japan Foundation](https://www.jpf.go.jp/e/), which is the only Japanese institution dedicated to the Japanese culture dissemination.

I have also made a dashboard with information about kanjis in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.silva2663/viz/Kanji_16451629254860/Dashboard?publish=yes). Furthermore I developed a tool to study kanjis optimally in a Notion template shared on [Gumroad](https://davidsilvaapango.gumroad.com/).
