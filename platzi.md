# Platzi

Platzi is an online education platform, where you can watch video lessons about working in technology. I am interested in learning Data Science, Internet of Things and Machine Learning.

## Certifications

In this section are placed the certificates that I consider most important:

## Projects

A good way to put into practice what you have learned in the courses is the implementation of projects. Either by means of programming language scripts or electronic circuits. By showing my projects in this space is a good way to share my knowledge. 

### Raspberry Bot

It is important to measure the quality of the environment because it can help us avoid respiratory problems. A good way to inspect the environment is using a bot. This Bot uses a Raspberry Pi3b, an MQ135 sensor, a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity, as well as using a WeMos D1 or NodeMCU card with an ESP8266 WiFi communication module. Thanks to these components, I can look at my house environmental conditions measurements from Twitter twice a day.
