## Python

Despite having studied Python in my Computational Physics subjects, I intended to increase my knowledge of this programming language. In an extracurricular course at FCFM in which advanced concepts of Python were reviewed.

## Centro de Investigaciones en Óptica (CIO)

I participated in the Summer of Scientific Research of the Mexican Academy of Sciences (AMC), this allowed me to satisfy my curiosity about optical fibers at the CIO. In this program I investigated the modes of propagation of light in optical fibers.

## Telescope Presentation

I was invited by MC Rafael Silva Íñiguez to present the telescopes of the Gral. Lázaro Cárdenas del Río High School (BUAP) on the night of the stars 2011. These telescopes were built in a pilot program by a group of students from the aforementioned high school. It is in this event when I began my outreach presentations in science.
