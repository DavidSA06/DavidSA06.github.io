# OSA

The [OSA](https://www.osa.org/en-us/home/) (Optical Society of America) is an association of individuals and companies engaged in optical research. There are several student chapters around the world, one of them is operating at BUAP carrying out scientific dissemination activities in schools and public events.

During my studies within the FCFM I served as treasurer, vice president and president of the student chapter. Thanks to this I have developed leadership, teamwork, communication, mentoring and team development skills. I was in charge of managing the chapter's financial resources and organizing various outreach activities such as congresses, experimental demonstrations, and groups of judges for scientific fairs. 

## Washington D.C. (Student Leadership Conference)

I had the opportunity to participate in the Student Leadership Conference in September 2017 in Washington D.C. In this congress, lectures on professional and academic opportunities were given, as well as explanations about scientific outreach methods.

During my visit, I was able to exchange ideas and do networking, listening to different points of view on the exchange of information and scientific dissemination. All of this helped me apply my ideas to the chapter in my role as president.

## LXI National Congress of Physics

At the LXI National Congress of Physics, my chapter met [Dr. William Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Daniel_Phillips), winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics. We took the opportunity to learn about his ideas and ask for advice on life in research and how to share the knowledge obtained in the laboratory, you can download the meeting summary [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/140cQXGWDPc1ejXlchRGBT12kZyrvAhIK/view?usp=sharing).

## IICILCA 

The Second Light, Science and Art Congress (IICILCA) aimed to create a multidisciplinary forum to disseminate, discuss and exchange knowledge of science and art around light, as a transversal axis. I participated in the organizing student committee. Thanks to the resources provided annually to our chapter, I invited [Dr. Todd Fansler](https://erc.wisc.edu/staff/fansler-todd/), OSA emeritus researcher who gave the conference that opened the congress.
